## Installation

The game can be played on a normal web browser. Download the package and open the index.html file. Enjoy!

## Gameplay

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down.

The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.

The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched. <br/>

Shortcuts:

* The player can restart the game hitting the 'r' key on the keyboard or clicking on the restart button as well.
* The user can flip the cards over by pressing keys from 'a' to 'k' and from 'z' to ',' on the keyboard.

## Score

The game displays a star rating (from 1-3) that reflects the player's performance. Amount of stars depends from moves:

* 3 stars: less than 20 moves
* 2 stars: until 35 moves
* 1 star: more than 35 moves

When the player starts a game, a displayed timer will also start.

The score board displays the current number of moves a player has made.
